# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project is a machine learning-based stock price prediction system that utilizes historical stock price data and various machine learning algorithms to forecast future stock prices. Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the many factors that influence market dynamics. This project aims to provide a starting point for developing predictive models and exploring different techniques in the field of financial forecasting.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
- Libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file

Clone this repository to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd stock-price-prediction

mathematica
Copy code

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

vbnet
Copy code

## Data Collection

The project uses historical stock price data from various sources such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or your preferred financial data provider. You can either download historical data manually or use data scraping techniques to collect the required data. Ensure that you have organized the data in a structured format.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the machine learning models, data preprocessing is essential. This includes handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory provide detailed examples of data preprocessing steps.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming relevant features that can improve the predictive performance of the models. It may also include creating technical indicators, sentiment analysis, or other domain-specific features.

## Model Training

The heart of the project lies in building and training machine learning models. Various algorithms can be used for stock price prediction, including but not limited to:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

The `models` directory contains Python scripts for training and saving different types of models. Experiment with various algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best-performing model for your dataset.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Visualize the predictions against actual stock prices to gain insights into model accuracy.

## Deployment

To deploy the model for real-time predictions, consider using web frameworks like Flask or Django to create a web application. You can also explore cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure for hosting the application and model.
